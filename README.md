# Together We Connect (TWC)

## Motivation

In times of emergency, such as natural disasters or conflicts, existing communication infrastructures are highly susceptible to failure. There is an urgent need to establish a backup communication system swiftly. Two primary approaches can be adopted:

1. The standard solution involves government intervention to rapidly rebuild the communication infrastructure, allowing the restoration of traditional communication methods within a limited scope.
2. An alternative is to utilize emerging network technologies, combining short-range and long-range communications with the capabilities of mesh networks to create a temporary network independent of traditional infrastructure.

Compared to the first approach, the second offers greater flexibility and resilience. It embodies the spirit of citizen science and mass participation, representing a more forward-looking solution. Inspired by the urgency and significance highlighted by conflicts such as the Ukraine-Russia war and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, this project aims not only to enable this technology but also to empower citizens to own and engage with it. Preparation in peacetime is crucial for readiness in emergencies.

Originating from Taiwan, amidst escalating geopolitical tensions and cross-strait relations, this project emphasizes the selection of source chips for hardware development, avoiding products that pose a national threat, and striving for lightweight, low-power, low-cost, and high cost-performance hardware solutions.

## Project Overview

The project encompasses several dimensions:

1. **Hardware Development**: We focus on developing open-source hardware based on source chips that meet the specific needs of this project.
2. **Scenario Simulation**: Different application scenarios are provided, along with the development of various training scripts.
3. **Tool Development**: We develop tools required for different application scenarios.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Knowledge of network technologies and mesh networks.
- Experience with hardware development and open-source projects.
- Understanding of the geopolitical context (especially regarding Taiwan) is beneficial.
